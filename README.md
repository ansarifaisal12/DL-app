# GODEL: Grounded Open Dialogue Language Model

GODEL is an advanced pretrained language model designed for dialog applications. Unlike traditional models, GODEL leverages grounded pre-training, making it adaptable to a wide range of dialog tasks that require external information, such as databases or documents, to produce high-quality responses. In various benchmarks, GODEL outperforms state-of-the-art models in few-shot finetuning scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in both human and automatic evaluations. This repository contains the code and resources for GODEL, contributing to the advancement of conversational AI and natural language processing research.
